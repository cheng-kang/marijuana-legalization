        <h1>Weed is legalized in Michigan yet rejected by North Dakota</h1>
        <p>
          On November 12, 2018, Michigan voters made the state the 10th in the
          U.S. — and the first in the Midwest — to legalize recreational
          marijuana. Voters in a second Midwest state, North Dakota, struck down
          a similar measure that would have legalized recreational use and
          expunged criminal records for prior marijuana offenders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recreational marijuana is already legal in Washington, DC, and nine
          other states: Washington, Oregon, Nevada, California, Colorado,
          Alaska, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts.
        </p>
        <h2>Michigan</h2>
        <p>
          Michigan’s Proposal 1 permits use for adults 21 and older, yet allows
          municipalities to ban or restrict marijuana use and commercial
          enterprise within their boundaries. The new law will allow individuals
          to grow up to 12 cannabis plants at a time. Public consumption remains
          prohibited. Michigan has provided for one of the lowest cannabis tax
          levels in the nation with retailers to pay a 10% excise tax, and
          consumers picking up the state’s 6% sales tax.
        </p>
        <p>
          While 56% of Michigan voted to support legalization, 44% opposed. The
          bill is expected to go into effect next year with sales beginning in
          2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I am proud of Michigan voters who have overwhelmingly supported this
          initiative and I am extremely excited about a future where law
          enforcement and our criminal justice system can focus on real crime
          and improve public safety,” Barton Morris Junior, founder of Cannabis
          Legal Group said.
        </p>
        <h2>North Dakota</h2>
        <p>
          North Dakota’s Measure 3 failed to pass. The brake on legalization
          comes as less of a surprise, as critics warned the bill lacked
          regulatory and enforcement details. The state’s proposal contained no
          mandatory tax on marijuana transfers or sales, making revenue
          projections uncertain. Proponents of the measure viewed it as critical
          criminal justice reform, as the state has one of the lowest marijuana
          consumption rates, yet is among the highest for prosecuting marijuana
          offenses.

          Cole Haymond, an Advisor for Legalize ND, said North Dakota is also
          home to veterans who could benefit from easier access to the drug.
          “With a state with a high percentage of veterans it’s disappointing if
          it doesn’t pass,” Haymod said ahead of the vote.
        </p>
        <p>
          Polls leading into midterm elections were mixed on the initiative. An
          October 11 – 14 poll found 51% of likely voters in favor of legalized
          recreational use, while an earlier October poll found 59% against the
          measure.While 59.5% of North Dakota voters ultimately said no to
          legalization, only 40.5% said yes.
